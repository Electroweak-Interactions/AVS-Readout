# AVS-Readout
Manual Readout code for AVS-47 Resistance Bridge

To build, open the `Temperature Logger V2.lvproj` project and find the "Build Specifications" item in the tree structure. Expand it, and find the item "Temperature Logger V3". Right click and view its properties, then edit the build path, and click build to build. 

I remember that I left myself a note in the `Temperature Logger V2.vi` VI, which contains a warning you should heed. I wish you the best of luck, with full knowledge that you will need it for the treacherous journey to come.
